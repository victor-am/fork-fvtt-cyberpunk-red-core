<p>Welcome to the 0.82.0 release!</p>
<p>This release is a Foundry V10 Baseline Release.  There are no
new features in this release other than to be compatible with
Foundry V10.  All V9 fixes through 0.81.5 should be included as part
of this release. As such, the links to the Feature Video still point
to 0.81 release features.</p>
