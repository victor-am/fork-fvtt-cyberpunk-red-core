# Contributing to the Project

If you're interested in helping out, we would love to hear from you! Even if you're not a coder we can help you get started. Never too late to start a new hobby! Look over the [project wiki](https://gitlab.com/JasonAlanTerry/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/-/wikis/home).

Read on to get a sense of the project's direction, the tools we use, and how we're organized. If you're still interested, continue to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gitlab.com/JasonAlanTerry/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/-/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) to set up your dev environment.

## Useful Tools

Have a look through here to get a sense of what you'll be using when contributing code to this project. You do not need to be an expert in all these things, they're provided as an overview.

- Our recommended IDE is [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
- Since our source code lives in gitlab, you'll need to understand [git](https://git-scm.com/).
    - This [article](https://dzone.com/articles/top-20-git-commands-with-examples) helps with understanding the concepts.
    - [This](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) page covers how to write good commit messages.
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a big deal too. You'll use npm to manage packages.
- Foundry uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to product HTML templates.
- Of course, you'll need to be aware of the [FoundryVTT API](https://foundryvtt.com/api/), and read through how to do [system development](https://foundryvtt.com/article/system-development/) in it. Lastly, there's always the [Foundry wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/home) for more help.

### Repository Layout

- All system code is located in the `src/` subdirectory. These files are then compiled/processed by our buldsystem which utilzes [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).
- `src/system.json` and `src/template.json` are necessary pieces to building a game system with Foundry. Check out the Foundry documentation for details on what those files are for.
- `serc/less` this is where all of our css fragments are kept, these fragments are then built uding Gulp as described above. If you want to mess with the style and presentation of the UIs, this is the place.
- `src/lang` is where we keep internationalization templates, but we only support English today
- `src/templates` is where the Handlebars templates live, which are transformed into HTML documents by Foundry when the time is right. Folks with an interest in improving the UIs will work in here.
- Lastly, the `src/modules` directory is where the JavaScript that extends Foundry functionality is kept. This is where the plumbing exists to make the UIs do useful things.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

For your first contribution, please make sure it is aligned with something in Gitlab first. If you have other things in mind, bring them in up Discord and see what the team thinks. More seasoned and regular contributors will get additional permissions in Gitlab to help steer and guide the project.

Setting up your environment is covered in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gitlab.com/JasonAlanTerry/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/-/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) now.
